                        <p>The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The rain in Spain falls mainly on the plain. A rose by any other name would smell as sweet.</p>
                        <p>Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise. A penny saved is a penny earned. An apple a day keeps the doctor away.</p>
                        <h3>Quotes From Past Celebraties</h3>

                        <p>Actions speak louder than words. The pen is mightier than the sword. Where there's smoke, there's fire.</p>
                        <p>Don't judge a book by its cover. You can't make an omelette without breaking eggs. Rome wasn't built in a day.</p>
                        <h3>Best Quotes of All Time</h3>

                        <p>Practice makes perfect. If at first you don't succeed, try, try again. The early bird catches the worm.</p>
                        <p>Time heals all wounds. All good things must come to an end. Every cloud has a silver lining.</p>
                        <p>When in Rome, do as the Romans do. When the going gets tough, the tough get going. You can't have your cake and eat it too.</p>
